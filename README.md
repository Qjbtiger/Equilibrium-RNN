# An optimization-based equilibrium measure describes non-equilibrium steady state dynamics: application to edge of chaos

Code for "An optimization-based equilibrium measure describes non-equilibrium steady state dynamics: application to edge of chaos" (Arxiv: 2401.10009v1). Here, we propose an optimization-based pseudo energy function to characterize recurrent neural network dynamics. Under the replica calculation in both finite and zero temperature cases, we found two kinds of order parameters describing the order-chaos transition.
